# Quiz Tic-Tac-Toe Project (C++)

Welcome to my Quiz Tic-Tac-Toe project! This C++ program is a creative twist on the classic tic-tac-toe game, combining it with a quiz system. Each move on the tic-tac-toe grid is determined by answering a randomly selected question. The project demonstrates my skills in C++ programming, user interaction, randomization, and game logic.

## Project Overview
- **Language:** C++
- **File:** `103project.cpp`
- **Concept:** Play tic-tac-toe, but each cell is filled only if you answer a quiz question correctly. The game features a welcoming animation, a grid display, and a set of 29 unique questions covering general knowledge, science, and religion.

## Features
- Animated welcome screen using ASCII art and timed output
- 3x3 tic-tac-toe grid, displayed with custom formatting
- 29 unique quiz questions, randomly assigned to grid positions
- Each move requires answering a question; correct answers fill the cell with 'T' (True), incorrect with 'F' (False)
- Win/lose logic based on tic-tac-toe rules (three in a row of 'T' or 'F')
- Replay and exit options after each game
- Error handling for repeated moves and invalid input

## What I Practiced & Learned
- Advanced use of functions and modular code in C++
- Random number generation and avoiding repetition
- User input validation and error handling
- Console-based UI with ASCII art and grid drawing
- Game logic for win/lose conditions and replay
- Combining knowledge quizzes with classic games for engagement

## How to Run
1. Make sure you are on Windows (uses `<windows.h>` for `Sleep` and `system` commands).
2. Compile the code with a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):
   ```bash
   g++ 103project.cpp -o quiz-tictactoe
   ./quiz-tictactoe
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play and answer questions.

## About This Project
This project is a reflection of my creativity and problem-solving in C++. It combines game development, quiz logic, and user experience in a single console application. I hope you enjoy playing and testing your knowledge!
